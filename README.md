## Overview

POPA Health AI integrates a robust FastAPI/Python backend with a modern React-based frontend to create a secure, scalable, and user-friendly patient engagement system. The platform seamlessly integrates with wearable devices (Apple HealthKit, Fitbit, Garmin) and EHR systems (FHIR/HL7) to collect and analyze patient data, providing healthcare professionals with real-time insights and patients with personalized recommendations.

## Features

- Conversational AI: Leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language processing and virtual health assistance.
- Predictive Analytics: Uses AI to monitor patient health data and generate personalized recommendations.
- Secure APIs: FastAPI backend with JWT-based authentication and advanced encryption for data privacy.
- Modern Frontend: React-based UI with animated dashboards and interactive elements.
- Device & EHR Integration: Connects to wearable devices and EHR systems to pull comprehensive health metrics.
- Scalable Infrastructure: Deployed on AWS using Kubernetes (EKS), with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Architecture

The system is designed with a microservices approach:

- Backend: FastAPI service handling secure API endpoints, authentication, and AI/ML services.
- Frontend: A React application providing a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard.
- Integration Modules: Services to connect with wearable device APIs and EHR systems using FHIR/HL7 standards.
- Infrastructure: AWS cloud deployment using EKS for container orchestration and Terraform for Infrastructure as Code.
- CI/CD: Automated builds, tests, and deployments using GitHub Actions.

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, JWT
- Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- AI/ML: Integration with LLMs (e.g., OpenAI API) and custom predictive analytics models
- Cloud & Infrastructure: AWS (EKS, RDS, S3), Terraform, Kubernetes
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Docker, AWS ECR

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Obionedonthoeme/POPA-Health-AI.git
cd POPA-Health-AI
```

2. Backend Setup:
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

3. Frontend Setup:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

### Infrastructure

Use Terraform to provision your AWS resources. From the `infrastructure` directory, run:

```bash
cd ../infrastructure
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### Containerization & Orchestration

Build Docker images for both the backend and frontend, and deploy them on AWS EKS using the provided Kubernetes manifests.

```bash
# Build Docker images
docker build -t backend:latest ../backend
docker build -t frontend:latest ../frontend

# Push images to AWS ECR
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
docker tag backend:latest <ecr_repo>/backend:latest
docker tag frontend:latest <ecr_repo>/frontend:latest
docker push <ecr_repo>/backend:latest
docker push <ecr_repo>/frontend:latest

# Deploy to EKS
kubectl apply -f k8s/backend-deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f k8s/frontend-deployment.yml
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project is integrated with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Every push to the `main` branch triggers the CI/CD workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`.

The workflow:
- Builds Docker images.
- Pushes images to AWS ECR.
- Deploys updated images to AWS EKS.
